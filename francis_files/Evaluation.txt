Evaluation (4)
Please use LLMs to help identify and write code for metrics and evaluations.
What was the initial prompt that you used? What was the initial output of the LLM? Validate the LLM response. How correct, relevant, and helpful was the LLM? How many prompts did you use?
Report the descriptions of metrics you use in the reproduction

The two main metrics we use are F1 score and Area Under Curve score. We also used other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity. F1 score is the harmonic mean of recall and precision that is calculated by F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). It is useful in cases where there is an imbalance in class distribution. We have 2 metrics for Area Under Curve/AUC. The first AUC metric is Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic/AUROC. It indicates the model's ability to discriminate across the possible thresholds of the research and like the F1 score is less sensitive to class imbalance.  The second AUC metric is Area Under Precision-Recall Curve/AUPRC. It gives a summary of the trade-off between precision and recall and is useful where there is an imbalance dataset especially when there is more false negatives than false positives. Accuracy measures the amount of correctly classified instances out of the total and is calculated by Accuracy = 1. * (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN); where T = True, F = False, P = Positive, and N = Negative. It is a good general measure that is easy to understand and can be used to compare with previous studies. Precision measures the amount of true positives out of all the positive predictions and is calculated by Precision = 1. * TP / (TP + FP). Recall measures the number of true positives that are correctly detected and is calculated by Recall = 1. * TP / (TP + FN). Because the primary purpose of the research is detecting apnea events which are true positives then this metric is particularly relevant. Specificity measures the number of true negatives that are correctly detected and is calculated by Specificity = 1. * TN / (TN + FP). It indicates how many non-apnea events are correctly identified as actual negatives which helps reduction of frequent false alarms.

The initial prompt we used to get Evaluation Metrics:
"Please provide the implementation of the metrics such as f1, auc, precision, accuracy, recall, and specificity. Please include the remaining implementation regarding evaluation."

The response is very relevant and helpful. The response was correct and we did not need to change this part of our code. It took us 1 prompt in order to get the metrics and evaluation to work as needed.
